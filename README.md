> **Note**
> The `mystmd` project is in **beta**. It is being used to explore a full MyST implementation and will change significantly and rapidly.
> The project is being developed by a small team of people on the Executable Books Project, and may make rapid decisions without fully public/inclusive discussion.
> We will continue to update this documentation as the project stabilizes.
