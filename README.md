# MyST Markdown Command Line Interface, `mystmd`


> **Note**
> The `mystmd` project is in **beta**. It is being used to explore a full MyST implementation and will change significantly and rapidly.
> The project is being developed by a small team of people on the Executable Books Project, and may make rapid decisions without fully public/inclusive discussion.
> We will continue to update this documentation as the project stabilizes.

Each package is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).

### Versioning & Publishing

`mystmd` uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to document changes to this monorepo, call `npm run changeset` and follow the prompts. Later, `npm run version` will be called and then `npm run publish`.

### Utilities

`mystmd` is built and developed using:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd mystmd
npm run build
```

## Developing

For the [mystmd](https://github.com/executablebooks/mystmd) library on GitHub, `git clone` and you can install the dependencies and then create a local copy of the library with the `npm run dev` command.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:executablebooks/mystmd.git
cd mystmd
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

This will create a local copy of `myst` for use on the command line and start various web-servers for testing.
